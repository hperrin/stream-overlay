    <h1>SylphWeed's Stream Overlay</h1>

    <p>
      You can use this app to show a borderless, transparent, click-through
      browser window for streaming. For example, you can show your Twitch chat
      stream on your display, over you game.
    </p>

    <p>
      I made this app because I would often not notice my chat messages, and I'd
      prefer to have them come up on the display I'm looking at, rather than
      only in OBS. It's also great for single monitor streamers.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>
      You need to use this app from the command line, by providing the URL as
      the argument. Use <code>stream-overlay --help</code> to see all the
      available options.
    </p>

    <h2>Interaction</h2>

    <p>
      When the window is focused (by clicking it on the taskbar/dock) it will
      have an opaque background, and a handle to drag it around. Once it loses
      focus, it will go back to a transparent, and will ignore all mouse events.
      It will be click-through, so you can click the apps begind it.
