<h2>SylphWeed's Stream Overlay</h2>

<p>
  This app shows borderless, transparent, click-through browser windows for
  streaming. For example, you can show your Twitch chat and alerts on your
  display, over your game.
</p>

<p>
  I made this app because I would often not notice my chat messages on my other
  monitor, and I'd prefer to have them come up on the display I'm looking at,
  rather than in an OBS overlay. It's also great for single monitor streamers.
</p>

<p>
  <img
    style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 500px;"
    src="{assets}/stream-overlay-clip.webp"
    alt="Screen capture showing Stream Overlay in use on top of a game."
  />
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
  Create a config file with your overlay setup and save it to your computer. You
  can then open the config file with the app, or launch it from the config
  editor.
</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<p>
  You can see a list of open overlay windows from the "Sylphweed's Stream
  Overlay" tray icon menu. Selecting one will focus that window. When a window
  is focused it will have an opaque background, and a handle to drag it around.
  Once it loses focus, it will go back to transparent, and will be click-through
  again, so you can click the apps behind it.
</p>

<h2>Fullscreen Apps</h2>

<p>
  Stream Overlay doesn't work over proper fullscreen windows, so your game needs
  to be in "borderless" or "borderless fullscreen" to allow Stream Overlay on
  top of it. If it's still not appearing on top, try setting it to windowed mode
  then back to borderless.
