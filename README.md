# SylphWeed's Stream Overlay

You can use this app to show a borderless, transparent, click-through browser window for streaming. For example, you can show your Twitch chat stream on your display, over you game.

I made this app because I would often not notice my chat messages, and I'd prefer to have them come up on the display I'm looking at, rather than only in OBS. It's also great for single monitor streamers.

## Usage

You need to use this app from the command line, by providing the URL as the argument. Use `stream-overlay --help` to see all the available options.

## Interaction

When the window is focused (by clicking it on the taskbar/dock) it will have an opaque background, and a handle to drag it around. Once it loses focus, it will go back to a transparent, and will ignore all mouse events. It will be click-through, so you can click the apps begind it.
