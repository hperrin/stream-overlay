      You can use this app to show borderless, transparent, click-through
      browser windows for streaming. For example, you can show your Twitch chat
      stream and alerts on your display, over your game.
    </p>

    <p>
      I made this app because I would often not notice my chat messages on my
      other monitor, and I'd prefer to have them come up on the display I'm
      looking at, rather than only in OBS. It's also great for single monitor
      streamers.

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>
      Duplicate <code>config.template.json</code> in the
      <code>resources/app</code> folder to <code>config.json</code>, then open
      it (like with Notepad) and modify the values to the windows you need. Then
      run the "stream-overlay" app.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also use this app from the command line, by providing the URL as
      the argument. Use <code>stream-overlay --help</code> to see all the
      available options.
    </p>

    <h2>Interaction</h2>

    <p>
      You can see a list of your windows from the "Sylphweed's Stream Overlay"
      tray icon. Right click the icon to show the menu. You can also exit the
      app from here.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a window is focused (by clicking it from the tray icon menu) it will
      have an opaque background, and a handle to drag it around. Once it loses
      focus, it will go back to transparent, and will ignore all mouse events.
      It will be click-through, so you can click the apps behind it.
    </p>

    <h2>Fullscreen Apps</h2>

    <p>
      Stream Overlay doesn't work over fullscreen apps, so your app needs to be
      in "borderless" or "borderless fullscreen" to allow Stream Overlay on top
      of it. If it's still not appearing on top, try setting it to windowed mode
      then back to borderless.
    </p>

    <h2>Config Options</h2>

    <p>These are the available options for each config entry (window):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>title</code>: The window title.</li>
      <li><code>url</code>: The URL of the page to show in the window.</li>
      <li>
        <code>width</code>: The width, in pixels, of the window, if it's not
        full screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>height</code>: The height, in pixels, of the window, if it's not
        full screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>x</code>: The X coordinate, in pixels, of the window, if it's not
        full screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>y</code>: The Y coordinate, in pixels, of the window, if it's not
        full screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>opacity</code>: The opacity of the window as a number between 0
        and 1, inclusive. This is not implemented in Linux.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>fullscreen</code>: Whether the window should be positioned full
        screen. (true/false) Be careful with this, as opaque windows can obscure
        your screen.
      </li>
    </ul>
