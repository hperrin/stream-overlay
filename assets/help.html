    <h1>Stream Overlay</h1>

    <p>
      You can use this app to show borderless, transparent, click-through
      browser windows for streaming. For example, you can show your Twitch chat
      stream and alerts on your display, over your game.
    </p>

    <p>
      I made this app because I would often not notice my chat messages on my
      other monitor, and I'd prefer to have them come up on the display I'm
      looking at, rather than only in OBS. It's also great for single monitor
      streamers.

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>
      Duplicate <code>config.template.json</code> in the
      <code>resources/app</code> folder to <code>config.json</code>, then open
      it (like with Notepad) and modify the values to the windows you need. Then
      run the "stream-overlay" app.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also use this app from the command line, by providing the URL as
      the argument. Use <code>stream-overlay --help</code> to see all the
      available options.
    </p>

    <h2>Fullscreen Apps</h2>

    <p>
      Stream Overlay doesn't work over fullscreen apps, so your app needs to be
      in "borderless window" or "borderless fullscreen" to allow Stream Overlay
      on top of it. If it's still not appearing on top, try setting it to
      windowed mode then back to borderless.
    </p>

    <h2>Interaction</h2>

    <p>
      When a window is focused (by clicking it on the taskbar/dock) it will have
      an opaque background, and a handle to drag it around. Once it loses focus,
      it will go back to transparent, and will ignore all mouse events. It will
      be click-through, so you can click the apps behind it.
